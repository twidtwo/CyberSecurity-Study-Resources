# Defensive Sec starting point
Defensive security and network management go hand in hand. Though most tools are not specific to an OS I would recomend picking an OS to focus on to get familiar with the command line and other elements of the os. 
 
 ## OSs to pick from
 
 unix - I would recomend using [fedora](https://getfedora.org/) for blue team because it is the most commonly used distro for servers. 
 
 windows - windows developer images can be installed here [Win 11](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/) or [Win <11](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) 
 
 mac - Uh I would not recomend. If you really want this might be a good iso image idk haven't checked might be malware [mac iso ?](https://techsprobe.com/download-iso-file-of-macos-catalina-10-15-virtual-images/)
 
# BUT IM A GOOD GUY !!!
You will also need to download a [kali](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-guest-vm/) or [parrot security edition](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/) iso. These are special distros of linux that come pre loaded with tons of hacking tools. You will need to simulate being an attacker sometimes. If you cannot run two virtual machines at once. I would recomend running linux natively or setting up a dual boot (preferably with a local drive to keep performance up).
