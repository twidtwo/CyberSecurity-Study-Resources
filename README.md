Links I've used to study

# Paid / Free
  Free content is just as good sometimes better as paid content. You pay for CONVIENCE or a certification 
  # Free platforms
    https://www.tryhackme.com - Beginner friendly variety of content 
    https://book.hacktricks.xyz/ - Good book of notes
    **Most free content is in blog posts and youtube videos it doesn't belong in this section other links are under specific topics
    
  # Paid Platforms
    https://www.tryhackme.com $10 a month - Beginner friendly
    https://www.hackthebox.com $10 + a month - Better hacking challenges then tryhackme but less beginner friendly
    https://pentesterlab.com/ $20 a month - Video walkthroughs more structured learning less googling to fill the gaps Specific badges for topics
 
# Background 
  The general order of things to learn before security is 
    Unix command line -> Basic Networking -> How the web works    -> Windows command line
                                             Common services         Powershell (get-help & invoke-webrequest is enough for now)
                                             Basics of python
